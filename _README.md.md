# (Loan Data from Prosper)
## by Awofolaju Afusat


## Dataset

> The dataset used for the analysis is a loan dataset from Prosper which consists of 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.

## Summary of Findings

> The main goal of my exploration analysis is to determine if some independent variables(EmploymentStatus, IncomeVerifiable, OnTimeProsperPayments, IsBorrowerHomeowner and Recommendations) i chose will affect/influence the dependent variable(ProsperScore). 

>The first thing i did in the exploration stage after i had gathered my dataset was to have a proper knowledge of my dataset by assessing it visually and programmatically. In the cause of doing that, i found some issues (missing values, incorrect datatype amongst others), i then proceeded to the cleaning stage where i plotted different kinds of plots ranging from univariate to bivariate and multivariate. It was deduced from the graph distributions that once you have a verifiable source of income, irrespective of your employment status, you are going to get a loan. Surprisingly, being a home owner doesn't mean the person is going to pay the loan on time. I also discovered that recommendations do not affect ProsperScore and lastly, those that pay their loans on time are always given and have high prosper score.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The key insights for the presentation will be distribution of ProsperScore to check which ProsperScore has the highest count, how employment status, income verifiable affects prosperScore.
>Also, i would like to check how being a home owner and getting recommendations influence the dependent variable (ProsperScore).
